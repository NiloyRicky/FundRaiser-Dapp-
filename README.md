# FundRaiser-Dapp-

This project is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Ethereum using Solidity and Hardhat. It allows users to create and manage campaigns for various causes, such as health, education, and animal welfare.

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project also demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

### Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
